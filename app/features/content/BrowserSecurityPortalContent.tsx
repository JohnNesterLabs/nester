        <h2>Browser-based Threat Detection and Response, Reimagined</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>SquareX is a pioneering Browser Detection and Response (BDR) platform that empowers enterprises to detect, prevent, and respond to web-based threats in real time. Combining advanced features like disposable browser isolation, granular data loss prevention (DLP), extension hijack detection, and GenAI misuse protection, SquareX delivers a unique layer of security directly at the browser level. </p>
  
        <p>However, as with many technically sophisticated security tools, the challenge was not in capability but in ensuring those capabilities were easily accessible, understandable, and actionable for diverse enterprise roles, from Chief Security Officers to IT administrators. </p>
        
        
        <h3>The challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Despite strong technical differentiation, the UX audit revealed several barriers that
          slowed adoption and reduced day-to-day efficiency:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fragmented task flows:</strong> Critical workflows such as deployment,
            threat monitoring and policy management were spread across disconnected sections,
            making configuration and response slower.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Steep learning curve:</strong> Admins often required hand‑holding from
            customer success teams due to unclear navigation, inconsistent terminology and
            limited contextual guidance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Poor information hierarchy:</strong> Key dashboards lacked actionable
            insights and essential metrics were hidden deep within multiple clicks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Navigation overload:</strong> A broad primary navigation led to scrolling
            menus, buried features and difficulty in discovering integration and configuration
            options.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limited onboarding &amp; in‑product help:</strong> New users had no guided
            tour or task‑based onboarding flow, forcing reliance on documentation or support
            calls.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          For a security product where response speed and clarity can directly impact an
          organization’s protection, these usability issues represented a serious risk to
          adoption, trust and long-term customer satisfaction.

        <h3>The solution</h3>
        <p>The redesign initiative, led by NesterLabs, combined UX strategy, information architecture overhaul and new visual design concepts . The approach was structured around three guiding policies: </p>
        <img src="/browserSecurity/s2.avif" alt="browser visuals frame 2" />
        
         <h3>New visual direction</h3>
         <p>
           SquareX goes beyond traditional cybersecurity by pioneering Browser Detection and
           Response; as the business scales to its next stage of growth, the product experience
           needs to match this evolution.
         </p>
         <p>
           A visual design refresh is not merely cosmetic. For a company like SquareX, scaling
           rapidly and entering a new phase of growth, the user interface becomes a signal of
           progress and trust.
         </p>
         <p>Key points we kept in mind while approaching the redesign:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Incorporating legacy brand elements</li>
           <li>Clarity first design approach</li>
           <li>A refresh that meant to suggest calm modernism</li>
         </ul>
        
       
        <h3>framed in light - The new visual design direction for SquareX product experience</h3>
        <p>The design explores how data and information shape the product experience, expressed through elegant, frosted surfaces that feel rich with texture.
        </p>
        <p>Depth and hierarchy are created by layering gradients, subtle textures, and light play, optimising brightness and softness for each element. This approach delivers a refined, modern aesthetic where clarity and elevation guide the user’s focus.
        </p>

        <h3>Key interventions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Task-based Information Architecture:</strong> Replacing object-only navigation
            with task-oriented categories (e.g., Monitor, Policies, Data &amp; Lists, Users,
            Exceptions) to match the mental models of admins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step-by-step onboarding flows:</strong> Wizards for deployment, policy
            creation and BYOD extension installation, reducing the need for external support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contextual guidance &amp; tooltips:</strong> Integrated help directly within
            relevant screens, explaining technical terms and suggesting next steps after threat
            detection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consolidated dashboards with actionable insights:</strong> Highlighting urgent
            security events, aggregated threat severity and recommended responses (“200
            unauthorized extensions detected: create a block policy”).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Modular navigation framework:</strong> Narrower primary navigation,
            consistent breadcrumb trails and tertiary navigation via in-page tabs to reduce menu
            scrolling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual design refresh:</strong> Three concepts explored, from dark mode
            data‑centric layouts to playful, brand‑forward UIs, balancing enterprise seriousness
            with SquareX’s youthful identity.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>The design impact</h3>
        <p>
          While the redesigned product is yet to be rolled out, the overhaul is expected to
          significantly improve how enterprise users experience and operate SquareX. Guided
          onboarding flows and self‑service deployment reduce setup effort, while a task‑based
          information architecture and clearer navigation make critical actions easier to
          discover without reliance on documentation. Actionable dashboards and contextual
          recommendations further shorten investigation‑to‑response cycles, improving
          day‑to‑day admin productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          These UX improvements are complimented by a clarity‑first visual direction that
          explores how data and information shape the product experience. Frosted, light‑framed
          surfaces introduce a calm, modern aesthetic, while layered gradients, subtle textures,
          and controlled use of light create depth and hierarchy. This balance of brightness and
          softness helps guide focus, reduce cognitive load and elevate important actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, the redesign positions SquareX as a security platform that feels both
          powerful and approachable – one that speaks the language of its users and enables
          faster, more confident decision‑making with fewer dependencies on external support.
