        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>Making it simpler for enterprises to manage their AI agent workforce </h3>
        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>Overview  </h3>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        As enterprises deploy AI agents alongside human teams, managing agent identities, permissions, behavior becomes critical. Astha.ai is a web based platform designed to provide the identity, security, monitoring layer required to manage AI agents at enterprise scale, while enforcing Zero Trust, reducing credential sprawl while maintaining compliance.

        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>The Challenge </h3>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        As AI agents increasingly become part of enterprise workflows, organizations struggle to answer fundamental questions. 
        </p>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        What are agents doing? who or what are they acting on behalf of? How can their access be governed safely?
        </p>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        Workflows become fragmented across multiple tools, platforms, creating inefficiencies, blind spots. Astha approached us with a problem. Enterprises lacked a reliable way to manage AI agent identities, security, without increasing complexity or risking compliance. As AI agents scaled, organizations struggled to maintain visibility, control, governance.
        </p>
      
        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>Our Approach</h3>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        Our approach focused on early design collaboration to translate complex security requirements into practical workflows. By simplifying agent onboarding, unifying fragmented processes and by embedding policy enforcement into everyday tasks, we helped shape a platform that delivers enterprise grade control, while remaining intuitive, scalable for both security teams and developers.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        A focused research led design process helped us align the product with real enterprise needs. Through stakeholder interviews, product walkthroughs, competitor analysis, defining personas, key use cases, we built a strong foundation that informed the concept design, shaping the information architecture, task flows, navigation, overall visual direction.
