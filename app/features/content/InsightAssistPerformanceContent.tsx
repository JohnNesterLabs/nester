        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>The Challenge</h3>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        RevOps operation teams rely on a growing stack of sales and analytics tools to understand performance, forecast outcomes, and identify bottlenecks. However, most existing RevOps platforms overwhelm users with dense dashboards, fragmented metrics, and complex workflows. Extracting meaningful insights often requires manual effort, cross tool comparisons, and deep analytical expertise.</p>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        Mid-level sales management and roles like Channel Managers and SDR management remain underserved, with existing tools failing to address their unique needs.</p>
