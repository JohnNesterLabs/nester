        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        Sanjeev & John came to us trying to figure out how to visualise the complex world of enterprise support in motion. What started as an animation project ended up being a full blown brand building partnership and the beginning of a beautiful relationship. We always love clients who are unafraid to shake things up a bit.

        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>Reframing the problem</h3>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        Pretty early in the conversation we agreed that this project needs a well thought out brand strategy if it had to have the impact that was envisioned. A 3 day workshop was conducted to ensure there is an alignment on who we are targeting and what king of tonal and visual vocabulary would actually hit the mark.

        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>Are we making a Kahuna-verse???</h3>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>
        As we started understanding support and began exploring, it started feeling that we are building for a very dynamic world. The need for an immersive experience, the complex processes, troubleshooting maps looking up history, artificial intelligence compressing dense diagnosis, engineers tinkering and tickets always moving forward. It had all the makings of a universe of it's own, if the audience could dive into this world, they would feel seen and also genuinely understand the technology that Kahuna was offering.

        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>How do you show intelligence? How does thinking feel?</h3>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>We have seen ChatGPT, Gemini and many others with such delightful micro-interactions showcasing thought processes but this felt fundamentally different. It was not just a product in use, it was a experiential understanding of dense information. Several concepts were created to explore the idea of a journey, of thinking, of human & thinking machines acting together. </p>

        <h3 className={styles.workDetailSubheading}>Processes visualised can be very engaging</h3>
        <p className={styles.workDetailParagraph}>Storyboarding the actual use cases has probably made us semi-experts at the support processes. Each object, character or metaphor had to come from a well thought out understanding of what is actually going on behind the scenes within the technology.</p>
